    "# ClauseGuard — Automated Contract Clause Classification & Risk Advice\n",
    "## Powered by RAG, Langchain, Azure OpenAI, and Azure AI Search\n",
    "\n",
    "In prior work (repo: https://github.com/DucDungTran/NLP/tree/main/Contract-clause-analysis-chatbot), contract-clause classifiers were developed by fine-tuning LegalBERT and RoBERTa, and a risk-advisory chatbot was implemented using a GPT model via the OpenAI API. This project leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with LangChain, Azure OpenAI, and Azure AI Search to enhance grounding and relevance. In particular, a european contract law book (PDF file: https://www.legiscompare.fr/web/IMG/pdf/CFR_I-XXXIV_1-614.pdf) is utilized to provide specific knowledge base for LLM models.\n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "The following Azure resources are required to carry out this project:\n",
    "* Azure OpenAI with two models: GPT-4.1 and Embedding model (text-embedding-3-large).\n",
    "* Azure AI Search.\n",

    "The introduction to building RAG in cloud can be found in the repo: https://github.com/DucDungTran/RAG/tree/main/rag-cloud.\n",

    "In this project, a RAG framework is developed via Langchain, Azure OpenAI and AI Search. The fine-tuned LegalBERT model performed in the prior work is then loaded to classify given contract clauses. After that, the clauses and respective classification results are fed into the RAG-based LLM model for risk analysis."

      "recipient having knowledge of the undertaking (like promises of a reward under German\n",

      "5 Other effects are specific to\n",
      "the characteristics of each contract. This is the case in respect of obligations intended by\n",
      "the parties and implied obligations such as those referred to in article 1135 of the French\n",
      "Civil Code.\n",
      "As for the real effects, German law proposes a particular analysis. In German law the\n",
      "real effects of a contract are separate from the meeting of wills. (§ 433, § 929BGB). This\n",
      "is what the Germans refer to under the term“Abstraktionsprinzip”: the contract creates\n",
      "the obligation, whereas the transfer of property occurs through another act, the two acts\n",
      "being independent of one another. This principle of “separability” is corrected by the\n",
      "mechanism of unjust enrichment (§ 812\n",
      "BGB). In the French and Italian systems, if a\n",
      "contract is terminated, the goods should be restituted. The merits of German law on this\n",
      "point should be taken into consideration, whilst it should be recognized that the most\n",

      "that “it must be observed that there is no contractual relationship between the sub-buyer\n",

      "In the Réunion européenne S.A case\n",
      "32 of 27 October 1998, theECJ again took the\n",
